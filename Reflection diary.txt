Setbacks Faced
1. Due to the broad scope of the project, there are some uncertain requirements and tasks that require a deeper understanding.

2. Personal reasons:
a. Due to my personal illness (eye disease), I was unable to facilitate the offline meeting with my team members at the first time, 
so I did not completely understand the project requirements at the meeting.
b. Because I didn't fully understand the tasks given in our first meeting, I didn't say anything effective.
c. My personal language barrier makes me face great challenges in this project. 

Reflection:
The first week is all about getting to know each other and understanding the basic content and background of the project.
Build a platform for communication and cooperation, discuss our first lecture, and have meetings and contacts with supervisors.
Due to my personal reasons, I did not integrate well into the team in the first week. I deeply reflected on myself.
Besides, I need to adapt to this environment faster.
